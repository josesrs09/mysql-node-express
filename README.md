# How to Build Rest API with NodeJs, Express and Mysql

### Tech

This example uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js]
* [Express]
* [mysql2]
* [bcryptjs]
* [jsonwebtoken]
* [express-validator]
* [dotenv]
* [cors]
* [winston]

### Getting Started

``` sh
# Get into the directory
cd mysql-node-express

# Edit .env file and add your mysql username, mysql password and db name
vi .env
# you can edit the file also via text editor

# Get into the db directory
cd src/db

# Import mysql database using Command line
mysql -u [db_username] -p[db_password] < create-user-db.sql
# you can edit the file if you want to change the db_name
# if you are using a different db_name and it elready exists,
# you can comment the first two lines, remain the line => USE test_db;
# and just change the db_name

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the server locally
npm start

# Run the server locally in dev mode
npm run dev
